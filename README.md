# The SLMIT Selling Hub!
This is a project containing different solutions and examples for XR and how different areas be affected by this technology!

<h2> Goals </h2>
<p>
  In this project, we had a main goal: to create different examples on where and how could XR be implemented.
</p>

<h2> Achieved </h2>
<p>
  We created 3 main examples: one for farms, one for industries and one for drugstores. They are all built to show specific situations related to the example itself. All the 3D objects and materials were made by us.
